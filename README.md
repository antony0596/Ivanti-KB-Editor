# Ivanti KB Editor
While working at Vail Resorts, we migrated to Ivanti Neurons for our ticketing system and knowledge base platform. As we were migrating our documentation, we found that the knowledge base editor was lacking in some areas. I came across Alex-D's Trumbowyg and leveraged it to put this text editor together. Allowing us to create documentation here, and copying the HTML code into Ivanti. Ahhh... so much better!
